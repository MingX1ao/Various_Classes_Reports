WARNING: [Drc 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net AC_RECLRC_OBUF is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin AC_PBLRC_OBUF_inst_i_1/O, cell AC_PBLRC_OBUF_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [Drc 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT AC_PBLRC_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 172 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
